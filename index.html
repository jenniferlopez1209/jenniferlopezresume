        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jennifer Lopez. I am studying at the University of California Riverside. I am a first generation college student majoring in Pre-Business. I plan to get my Bachelor degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. I will graduate in 2026. I am the oldest daughter of Mexican immigrant parents. I have two younger siblings who are still in middle and high school. Being the oldest daughter in a family with immigrant parents means that I am learning for everyone because I will one day have to teach  my younger sibling to do what I am doing right now. I was born and raised in the San Fernando Valley but decided to come study at riverside because of their great business program and it reminded me of home. I am currently in my first year of college and I am dorming on campus. Being away from home is scary because it means that I am now going to have to make decisions without my family but it is also good because I learn to become independent and I get more freedom than if I were still living with my parents. <br><br>

        My skills involve but are not limited to creative and technical skills. My technical skills include basic skills in Google (Docs, sheets, Slides, and forms), basic skills in Digital Design Software (Canva, Picsart, and video editing apps), and proficient skills in Social Media (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube). I am bilingual, I can read and write fluently in English and Spanish. I have creative experience where I was/am a beauty content creator on the Tik Tok platform. I design, produce, and upload beauty videos that show creativity and personality. My greatest accomplishment on the app was obtaining up to 600 thousand views and 140 thousand likes on a makeup look about my country.<br><br>

        In high school I was involved in many extracurricular activities that allowed me to have a leadership role and gain experience. I was chief of design and photography for the yearbook committee during my junior and senior year. I managed individual and team deadlies, supervised final outlines, and booked appointments and created teams to attend events for interview/photoshoot purposes. I was also the president of the senior activities committee. In the committee we planned and organized events/activities for the graduating high school senior class. I developed fundraising ideas to maximize profits to reduce the overall cost of the senior package. I was also the social media manager for the senior class where I managed social media platforms and school wide outreach to keep students informed on the latest updates for the events or announcements.
